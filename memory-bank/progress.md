## [2025-06-24] Supabase Template Sync Migration

- Migrated all template configuration and active state persistence from local files to Supabase (`site_config` table).
- Refactored `/api/allset/templates` and `/api/allset/templates/update` endpoints to read/write config from Supabase.
- Frontend TemplateSelector now fetches latest config from backend after updates, fixing stale/cached UI issues.
- Added detailed logging in backend and frontend for easier debugging.
- Fixed Prettier/ESLint formatting errors blocking build.
- Documented and created all required Supabase tables (emails, config, etc.) for production use.
- Next build now passes; all config is cloud-native and Vercel-compatible.
- Refactored backend endpoint for template update to use `updateActiveTemplate` for validation and update, centralizing logic and reducing duplication.

## Next Steps

- Finalize instant UI update for template change (minor frontend adjustment pending).
- Add frontend fallback if Supabase is unavailable.
- Expand tests and validation coverage.
