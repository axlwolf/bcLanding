## Supabase Migration (2025-06-24)

- All template and site configuration is now stored in the `site_config` table in Supabase.
- Endpoints `/api/allset/templates` and `/api/allset/templates/update` have been refactored to use Supabase as the single source of truth.
- Frontend now fetches and updates config directly from the backend, eliminating stale/cached UI bugs.
- See `memory-bank/progress.md` for detailed migration history.
